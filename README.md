## Overview
OCR-Searchable-PDF-Tool is a powerful desktop application that converts non-searchable image-based PDFs into full searchable PDFs using Tesseract OCR — packed inside a sleek GUI & shareable as a Windows .exe. This tool works completely offline, costs zero and produces highly accurate OCR text embedded into your original PDF.

## Inspiration Behind This Project
A real incident created this idea:

**“Someone gave me a PDF and asked me to search a name inside it.
But the PDF was made from images of a Word file — so Ctrl+F didn’t work.
I tried many tools online, but most were paid or added watermarks.
At that moment, I decided to build my own OCR software — free, accurate, and easy for everyone.
Now I’m sharing it publicly as a .exe tool so no one faces the problem I faced.”**

This mindset led to the creation of OCR-Searchable-PDF-Tool — a professional Python + Tesseract project that helps thousands of users convert any PDF into a searchable format.

## Features
- **Drag & Drop PDF**: Easily drop your PDF into the window.
- **Fast & Accurate OCR**: Uses Tesseract 5 OCR with optimized settings (--oem 3 --psm 1).
- **Searchable Output**: You get a perfectly searchable, highlightable, copy-able PDF.
- **Image + Text Layer**: 
- Final PDF contains:
  * your original high-quality image
  * hidden text layer for searchability
- **Progress Bar + Time Estimate**: Track progress page-by-page.
- **Auto-close After Completion**: After success, it opens folder → shows success → closes automatically.
- **Standalone Windows EXE**: No Python required. Just download & run.
