## Overview
OCR-Searchable-PDF-Tool is a powerful desktop application that converts non-searchable image-based PDFs into full searchable PDFs using Tesseract OCR — packed inside a sleek GUI & shareable as a Windows .exe.
This tool works completely offline, costs zero and produces highly accurate OCR text embedded into your original PDF.

## Inspiration Behind This Project
A real incident created this idea:

“Someone gave me a PDF and asked me to search a name inside it.
But the PDF was made from images of a Word file — so Ctrl+F didn’t work.
I tried many tools online, but most were paid or added watermarks.
At that moment, I decided to build my own OCR software — free, accurate, and easy for everyone.
Now I’m sharing it publicly as a .exe tool so no one faces the problem I faced.”

This mindset led to the creation of OCR-Searchable-PDF-Tool — a professional Python + Tesseract project that helps thousands of users convert any PDF into a searchable format.
